# Flutter User Form App


## Getting Started

The first page is a form where the user can fill in and submit the form as many times as s/he wants.

The second page will show all the data from the first page in table manner.

## Tools

The tools below are required for you to complete this test:

IDE: Android Studio or VSCode

Flutter/Dart SDK

You may find an installation guide on IDE and Flutter/Dart SDK here. There are also tutorials about how to create an app using Flutter here.


The following functionality is complete:

* [x] Create a class/object that can store an email, and at least another three different values.
* [x] Create the appropriate UI for the user to fill in all of the fields for the values. 
* [x] The email should not be empty and is validated using email validator package. This means that the user should not be able to submit the form if the email is empty or does not pass the validation. 
* [x] The name should not be empty and the user should not be able to submit the form if the name is empty. 
* [x] Use the objects that are created from the first page and pass it to the second page. Then show all of the data in a table manner using those objects.
